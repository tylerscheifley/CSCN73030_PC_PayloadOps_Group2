## Overview
Welcome to Project V Space Payload Operations Simulator! This web application was developed as part of a course project where our team focused on designing a system to simulate space payload operations. With this application, we aimed to create a seamless experience for sending requests to other teams, initiating requests to the space station's image payload, receiving and saving images, and managing them efficiently.

## Features
Request Management: Easily send and manage requests to other teams within the simulation, creating a collaborative environment for space payload operations.

Payload Interaction: Initiate requests to the space station's image payload, simulating real-time interactions with the space environment.

Image Handling: Efficiently receive, save, and load images onto the front end, providing a visual representation of payload data.

Database Integration: Seamlessly store and retrieve payload data within the application's database for persistent and organized data management.

## Technology Stack
This application is built using the MERN stack, combining the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to create a robust and scalable solution.
